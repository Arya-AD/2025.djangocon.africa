        Reviewing submissions for DjangoCon Africa can be a
        challenging task, with many excellent talks and tutorials vying for a
        limited number of slots. To ensure transparency and fairness, we're
        committed to making our selection process clear to all submitters and
        attendees. Our main approach is community driven and it involves a team
        of volunteers and organizers who will review submissions anonymously and
        collectively decide which ones to feature.

          Read, understand, and agree to our Code of Conduct. As a speaker, your talk and
          your slides will need to follow our Code of Conduct – if you are not sure what

          Make sure you spend some time and effort on your proposal. Typos, lack of
          formatting, and half finished sentences are unnecessary and make your proposal
          hard to be taken seriously. (Ask a mentor, Check the links in our speakers
          resources, or a friend to help if this is difficult for you.)

          Don't overdo it – two or three paragraphs are plenty of space to give us an idea
          of your talk, we don't require an entire thesis.

          {% blocktranslate %}
          Original content: Since we have little space and lots of submissions, we prefer
          original content. If your talk is so awesome that you want to give it in
          multiple places, we'd ask you to consider putting a new spin on it, if at all
          possible.

        We will provide options to upload a rough transcript of your talk approximately
        two weeks before the conference to give the captioning team a chance to train on
        any jargon you might use in your talk. This is by no means required but it will
        provide a more accessible experience to your audience.

        However, the organizing team reserves the right to request a review of draft
        slides at any point up to the start of the conference for any reason including
        but not limited to content, messaging quality, and more. Failure to provide
        these slides in a timely manner may result in your removal from the program. We
        understand that the slides are draft quality and will not be shared outside the
