<div class="dj-container pt-[72px] md:pt-[88px] pb-16">
  <h1 class="text-center">Code of Conduct</h1>
  <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-8 md:max-w-[740px] mx-auto pt-10 lg:pt-8">
    <p>
      Everybody who participates at DjangoCon Africa in one way or another is
      required to conform to this Code of Conduct (CoC). This includes
      attendees, speakers, sponsors, organisers and volunteers. <br /><br />
      We will introduce a Code of Conduct team that will be primarily
      responsible for handling any incidents at the conference. The CoC applies
      before and throughout the event (including related activities such as
      social events, and social media).
    </p>
    <div>
      <h2 class="mb-4">Why do we have a Code of Conduct?</h2>
      <p>Our goals with having this Code of Conduct are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Helping everyone feel safe and included. Many attendees are first
          timers, or have had poor experiences in other events. We want to set
          the expectation that harassment and other unpleasant behavior are not
          acceptable. So that if people do have an unpleasant experience, they
          know that’s not neither the norm nor acceptable to us as a community.
        </li>
        <li>
          Helping to build trust that if an incident is reported, we will not
          respond with victim blaming, and that we will do a thorough
          investigation. Even, for example, if the incident concerns someone in
          a position of power.
        </li>
        <li>
          Informing everyone of the expected behavior. We are a diverse
          community, and having a Code of Conduct makes the expectations of
          everybody’s behavior explicit and transparent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Having a framework for report handling. The Code of Conduct is the
          basis for dealing with a report, assessing whether the CoC was
          violated, and what action should be taken.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="mb-4">Our Code of Conduct</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Be kind and considerate to others. Do not insult or put down other
          attendees. Behave professionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
          for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, culture, national origin,
          colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational
          level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age,
          size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and
          physical ability.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
          This includes offensive comments related to the categories above,
          deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
          recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, violent
          threats or language, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
          sexual attention.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior is also not
          acceptable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any venue to which
          the CoC applies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t publish individual photographs of people without their consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist,
          and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive and unwelcoming to those
          around you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for
          DjangoCon Africa.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="mb-4">Where does the Code of Conduct apply?</h2>
      <p>
        This Code of Conduct applies to all conference related spaces. That
        includes, but is not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The conference venue(s)</li>
        <li>The conference hotel(s)</li>
        <li>Any conference related social activities</li>
        <li>
          Slack channels, tweets with the conference hashtag, and other online
          media
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Code of Conduct does not exclusively apply to events on the
        conference agenda. For example, if after a scheduled social event you go
        to a bar with a group of fellow participants, and someone harasses you
        there, we would still treat that as a CoC violation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="mb-4">What can happen if the CoC is violated?</h2>
      <p>
        In case of a Code of Conduct violation, some of the most common actions
        organisers may take are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Demanding that a participant stops their behavior.</li>
        <li>
          Demanding that a participant prevents further contact with certain
          other participants.
        </li>
        <li>Not publishing the video of a conference talk.</li>
        <li>Cancelling a conference talk.</li>
        <li>Removing a participant from the conference, without refund.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        The action taken is at the discretion of the Code of Conduct team.
        Participants are expected to comply immediately, and further action may
        be taken in case a participant does not comply. A record will be kept of
        all incidents.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="mb-4">Where to report incidents</h2>
      <p>
        If a Code of Conduct incident happens to you, or witness it happening to
        someone else, please contact the CoC team immediately either in person,
        or by sending an email to <a
          href="mailto:conduct@djangocon.africa"
          class="underline inline-block"
          >conduct@djangocon.africa</a
        >. In urgent cases, you can also phone us on. <br />
        Our Code of Conduct team consists of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anna Makarudze</li>
        <li>Daniele Procida</li>
        <li>Jessica Upani</li>
        <li>Humphrey Butau</li>
        <li>Abigail Dogbe</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        The team members will be introduced in person at the conference. You can
        approach any of them at any time to discuss an incident or concern. You
        can also ask any other staff to help you find them at the conference.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="mb-4">Guidelines for reporting incidents</h2>
      <p>
        Please do not feel like you may be a burden to us by reporting
        incidents. Even if you happen to report multiple incidents during the
        conference. We rather consider reports an opportunity for us to act: by
        knowing about an incident, we can act on it, and often prevent it from
        continuing or repeating. But if we don’t know, we can’t take action.
        <br /><br />
        If you are not sure whether the situation was a Code of Conduct
        violation, or whether it applied to that particular space, we encourage
        you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports
        where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an
        actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the
        incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not
        violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve
        the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.
        <br /><br />In your report please include, when possible:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you)</li>
        <li>
          Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If
          there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as
          well.
        </li>
        <li>
          When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as
          possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your account of what occurred. If there is a written record (e.g.
          tweets or slack messages) please include screenshots, or otherwise a
          link.
        </li>
        <li>Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.</li>
        <li>If you believe this incident is ongoing.</li>
        <li>Any other information you believe we should have.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you don’t have some of this information, or not at this time, please
        still make the report anyways. <br /><br />
        If you feel unsafe reporting in person, you may choose someone to
        represent you. In this case, we’d need their contact information, but
        we’d ask you to make clear that this person represents you.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="mb-4">Other assistance</h2>
      <p>
        Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
        security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
        those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
        conference. However, we will not contact security or law enforcement
        without your consent, except when not doing so would create significant
        danger for other participants. <br /><br />
        We value your attendance, and look forward to seeing you at DjangoCon
        Africa. <br /><br />This Code of Conduct was adapted from <a
