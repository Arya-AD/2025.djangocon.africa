        The African Django community is excited to announce the first DjangoCon
        Africa event, taking place this year in¬†Zanzibar, Tanzania, from¬†6th -
        11th November 2023. The first event since the global pandemic postponed
        our planning in 2020. We are thrilled to convene, support one another
        and give back to the African Python web community now that travel and
        health safety guidelines have normalized.¬†DjangoCon Africa 2023 will be
        held at¬†the State University of Zanzibar¬†where we have three meeting
        rooms, one auditorium, 15 minutes away from food and activities, and
        convenient access to students, professionals, and international
        travelers.

      <h2 class="mb-4">About DjangoCon Africa</h2>
      <p>
        DjangoCon Africa will include 3 days of single-track talks, 2 days of
        workshops and sprints, and one day of touring for international
        visitors. <br />
        The event will also include a Django Girls workshop to be held the
        weekend before DjangoCon Africa. To make the conference as inclusive as
        possible, the event will offer financial aid to members of
        under-represented communities in software to ensure they can also
        attend.<br />
        The CFP, which is open to all, will also be announced as soon as
        the¬†month of June.
